# Fireworks Display

A Python turtle graphics program that creates a nighttime fireworks show.

## How it works

**Sky & Ground:**
- Creates a black night sky
- Adds green grass at the bottom
- Places a red picnic blanket on the grass

**Stars:**
- Generates 50 random star positions across the sky
- Draws small white stars at each position

**Fireworks:**
- Each firework starts below the grass
- Launches up to its position in the sky
- Bursts into 12 colorful lines radiating outward
- Uses different colors for each line

**Moon:**
- Draws a yellow circle
- Overlaps it with a black circle to create a crescent shape
